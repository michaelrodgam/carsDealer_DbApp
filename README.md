This is an academic project, part of the "Building Database Applications in PHP" course from University of Michigan, available on Coursera. I will get a certification when I finish this project.

I'm using XAMP (Windows, Apache web server, MySQL database manager and PHP) to build this app.

20/08/2020. Well, this course was a good practice for me, I have completed it with a score of 96% overall. In the end this project become a CRUD web app, I don't expected that. Anyway, it's complete now so I will not work in it anymore.
